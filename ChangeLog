Only the patchset, made from the snapshot of forked code in its state which was actually used for conversion of several large-ish ODT texts with lots of formulas. 
This code wouldn't produce instantly compilable LaTeX source, but it wouldn't throw out Cyrillics in formulas and bibliography entries' names, either.
Proved compilation and work with JDK 1.8.0_271.
**Known not-processed elements:**
1) Superscripted all-numbers sequences like 11400.
2) User-created StarMath dictionary entries.
3) All kinds of counters if those have Cyrillics in names (figures, formulas, etc.)
I didn't work on it for more than a year and might forget something.
Patchset needs to be applied from `source` subdirectory.
