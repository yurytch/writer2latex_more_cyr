# writer2latex_more_cyr
writer2latex OpenOffice.org extension modified to be more permissive about Cyrillics in ODT elements

This is a fork of the official writer2latex codebase [https://writer2latex.sourceforge.net/], based on its state in December 2021, as taken from SVN.
These modifications allow for wider use of Cyrillics specifically in formulas and in bibliography entries, and also allow for compilation with newer versions of Java toolkit.
